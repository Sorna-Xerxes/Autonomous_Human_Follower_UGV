![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b704d56-c9cf-424e-8e56-99f5b54bc97c)

## ABSTRACT
**Task 1,** a Python script leveraging computer vision techniques and OpenCV library will be developed to detect humans within a camera's view. A control loop will then adjust the camera orientation to keep the human centrally located in the frame.

**Task 2** involves writing firmware for an STM32 microcontroller board to collect IMU data and correct any camera misalignment caused by robot movement or environmental factors. Sensor fusion algorithms will be implemented to enhance tracking accuracy.

**Task 3** focuses on integrating a Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) system to improve the robot's spatial awareness and movement accuracy. This involves fusing visual information from cameras with inertial data from IMUs, enabling precise navigation and mapping without GPS.

The project outcomes include gaining proficiency in implementing computer vision algorithms, developing real-time firmware for microcontrollers, applying sensor fusion algorithms, and understanding Visual-Inertial Odometry principles. Soft skills such as problem-solving, project management, teamwork, and communication will also be enhanced throughout the project.

Overall, this project seeks to advance the capabilities of autonomous systems in dynamic environments through the integration of multiple sensory inputs for robust navigation and control.
